        <p>The <strong>SCP Foundation</strong> is one of the most intriguing and mysterious fictional organizations in modern internet culture. It started as a collaborative online writing project and has evolved into a vast, multi-faceted universe that blends horror, science fiction, and speculative fiction. The stories of the SCP Foundation focus on the containment of paranormal entities, objects, and locations that defy the laws of physics and biology. These anomalies, known as SCPs, can range from harmless artifacts to terrifying creatures with reality-bending abilities. </p>
        <p>What makes the SCP Foundation so unique is the sense of realism that is woven into its narrative. Despite the fantastical nature of the SCPs, the Foundation itself operates like a secretive and highly organized global institution, dedicated to keeping the world safe from these anomalies while maintaining secrecy.

        <h2>About the SCP Foundation</h2>
        <p>The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization tasked with the identification, capture, and containment of anomalous entities, objects, locations, and events, collectively known as SCPs. These anomalies are considered to be dangerous, unpredictable, and potentially harmful to the public, which is why they are kept under strict control. The Foundation's mission is to secure, contain, and protect humanity from these anomalies, ensuring that they do not pose a threat to global stability.</p>
        <p>Each SCP is assigned a number, and each SCP is classified based on its level of danger. The most common classifications are Safe, Euclid, and Keter. Safe SCPs are those that can be easily contained with minimal effort, while Euclid SCPs are more difficult to contain and may require special procedures. Keter-class SCPs are the most dangerous and unpredictable, requiring extensive security measures to keep them under control.</p>
        <p>In addition to its containment duties, the SCP Foundation conducts research on its anomalies to understand their origins, behavior, and potential uses. Some anomalies are even considered beneficial, while others present a threat to humanity. The Foundation's staff, which includes researchers, field agents, security personnel, and more, work tirelessly to ensure the safety and secrecy of their operations.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of the SCP Foundation</h2>
        <p>The origins of the SCP Foundation date back to the early 2000s when it began as an internet-based horror writing project. The first SCP story, SCP-173, was posted to the 4chan boards in 2007. This entry told the story of a terrifying statue that could only move when not being observed. The statue would attack anyone who came within its line of sight, snapping their necks before returning to its original position.</p>
        <p>Following the success of SCP-173, other users began to contribute their own stories and concepts, leading to the creation of the SCP Wiki. The Wiki served as a platform where writers could submit their own SCPs, each with their own detailed backstory, containment procedures, and often, terrifying descriptions of the anomalies. This collaborative writing effort quickly gained traction, and the SCP Foundation grew into a global phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the SCP Wiki has expanded to include thousands of entries, each building upon the rich tapestry of the SCP universe. The community behind the Foundation is known for its creativity and dedication to maintaining a consistent and immersive world. Writers have collaborated on projects such as video games, tabletop role-playing games, and even audio dramas that bring the terrifying world of the SCP Foundation to life.</p>

        <h2>Famous SCPs</h2>
        <article class="scp">
            <h3>SCP-173</h3>
            <p>SCP-173 is perhaps the most well-known of all the SCPs. It is a statue made of rebar, concrete, and spray paint that appears to be completely immobile when observed. However, when it is not being watched, it can move at incredible speeds and is capable of snapping the necks of its victims. The entity is extremely hostile and will kill anyone who comes within range of its line of sight. Containment protocols for SCP-173 are stringent, requiring at least three personnel to maintain constant visual contact with the entity at all times.</p>
            <p>Despite its simple concept, SCP-173 has become one of the most iconic SCPs, often serving as the face of the Foundation's terrifying world. It has inspired countless fan theories, adaptations, and references in various forms of media.</p>

        <article class="scp">
            <h3>SCP-096</h3>
            <p>SCP-096, also known as "The Shy Guy," is a humanoid entity that reacts violently when someone views its face. The creature is typically docile, but if its face is seen—either directly or through a photograph or video—it will enter a state of extreme distress and hunt down the individual who saw it. SCP-096 will relentlessly pursue its target, no matter where they are, until the target is dead. Afterward, it will return to its docile state and will not remember the event.</p>
            <p>The entity is one of the most terrifying SCPs, partly due to its relentless nature and the fact that it can be triggered by something as simple as looking at its face in a video. As a result, the containment protocols for SCP-096 are incredibly strict, requiring total isolation of its face from all external sources.</p>
